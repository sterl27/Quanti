Your starting script is well-structured for analyzing the probabilities of stock price movements within specified percentage ranges. The next step is to decide which component to add. Here are some suggestions:

Trend Analysis: Add a section to analyze the overall trend of the stock price over time. This could involve plotting a line graph of the closing prices or calculating and plotting moving averages.

Volatility Analysis: Introduce a section to analyze the stock's volatility. This might include calculating the standard deviation of the daily price changes or other volatility metrics.

Technical Indicators: You could add calculations for technical indicators like RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), or Bollinger Bands.

Comparative Analysis: If you have data for another stock (like NVDA, as in your previous script), you could add a section to compare the performance of the two stocks.

Correlation Analysis: If you include another stock, you might add a correlation analysis to see how closely the stocks' movements are related.

Fundamental Analysis: If applicable, add a section analyzing fundamental aspects like P/E ratios, EPS growth, etc.
